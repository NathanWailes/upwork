## Starting a new project
1. Create a new folder for the project.
    - It should be in the appropriate year and month folders.
1. Create a `solution_README.md` file.
1. Create a new virtual environment for that project.
1. List the version of Python you're using in the `solution_README.md` file.

## Before submitting the project
1. Create a `requirements.txt` file for the project.
1. Add instructions for how to use the `requirements.txt` file to the `solution_README.md` file.
    - Or maybe just add a link to instructions for how to use it.
